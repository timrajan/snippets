Based on my research, the major Australian banks (CommBank, NAB, West NABCommbankpac, ANZ) stopped accepting foreign currency cheques in 2022, and Bendigo Bank also ceased accepting foreign cheques from June 30, 2023 Bendigo Bank. Here are your options:
Best Solution: Switch to Direct Transfer with Computershare
The most practical long-term solution is to contact Computershare and change your payment method from cheques to direct bank transfer (wire transfer/EFT). Computershare charges a $5 USD fee for cheques or $10 USD for electronic funds transfer Whirlpool, and payments must generally be $100 USD or more to use their Global Wire service Computershare.
You can make this change:

Online through Computershare's Investor Centre
By submitting their payment method form

You'll need your Australian bank's SWIFT code and account details.
For Your Current Cheque:
Unfortunately, options are very limited:

Return it to Computershare - Request they reissue as a wire transfer or a new cheque you can deposit elsewhere
Open a US bank account - Some people open a US Bank of America account that allows mobile cheque deposits via their app, then transfer to Australia (though this involves multiple fees)
Hunt for smaller banks - You could try calling around smaller credit unions or regional banks, but most have stopped this service. Some people have reported needing at least 6 months validity remaining on cheques for any bank to accept them Expat Forum
Currency exchange services - Try contacting specialist currency exchange services (not banks) to see if they'll cash it
