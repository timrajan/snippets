Subject: Request for Azure App Registration - SharePoint Excel Reader

Hi [IT Team],

I need to create a Node.js application that reads Excel files from our SharePoint site. 
This requires an Azure App Registration with the following minimal permissions:

- Sites.Read.All (to access SharePoint sites)  
- Files.Read.All (to read Excel files)

Could you please create an app registration and provide:
- CLIENT_ID (Application ID)
- CLIENT_SECRET  
- Confirm TENANT_ID: [your-tenant-id-you-found]

This is for [business purpose - e.g., automated reporting, data analysis, etc.]

The application will only READ data, not modify anything.

Thanks!
