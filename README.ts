Yes, check34.png shows the exact same scoring issue. The user drew a rectangle around "Work feels simpler with the right tool" (an h1 heading) but the checkpoint dialog shows "GuidejarForWindows_Link"       
  instead.

  3. Try creating a checkpoint by drawing around the "Work feels simpler with the right tool" heading

❯ I failed to take the scoring mechanism logic. Can you give me the scoring mechanism logic once again? I believe we need to revisit the scoring mechanism. We can't just like that place H1 has more            
  scoring than a link or something like that. So we need to have a universal, common sense-based scoring mechanism. Give me the scoring mechanism once again - don't make any changes further. Give me the       
  scoring mechanism in a way that I can explain it to my 10-year-old. Give me a story-like explanation so that you can explain the scoring mechanism in a way that a 10-year-old can understand.

  Imagine you're playing a game on a webpage. You draw a rectangle with your finger around something you want to select - maybe a big title, a button, or a link.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Now, ALL the elements on the page that touch your rectangle enter a contest. They all want to be chosen. Each element gets a score, and the element with the highest score wins.

  The VIP pass gets multiplied by how well the element matches:

  🚨 Problem #2: Even though the heading matched BETTER (90% vs 60%), the link still has 6× higher score because of its VIP pass!

  Links, buttons, checkboxes get a HUGE bonus if they're mostly inside your rectangle:

A heading that's 100% contained gets +0.

  Imagine a playground where:                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  1. Some kids start with gold medals (links, buttons) before the race even begins                                                                                                                               
  2. Other kids start barefoot (headings, text) with no advantages                                                                                                                                               
  3. When barefoot kids keep winning races, the teacher gives them rocket shoes (heading_bonus = 350,000)                                                                                                        
  4. Now rocket shoes beat gold medals, so gold medal kids want jet packs                                                                                                                                        
  5.

  The fundamental problem: The system was built assuming users ALWAYS want to click on buttons and links. It never considered that someone might want to select a heading or text.

  🤔 What SHOULD Matter?                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  If I were a 10-year-old explaining what should matter:                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  1. "Did I draw my rectangle around THIS thing?" (coverage + containment)                                                                                                                                       
  2. "Is THIS thing the right size for my rectangle?" (size match)                                                                                                                                               
  3. "Is THIS thing what I actually see?" (visibility, not hidden behind stuff)                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  That's it. Whether it's a button, a heading, or a picture shouldn't change how "good" the match is. The rectangle I drew should tell you what I want.

  The only reason the heading might win now is because of that artificial 280,000 bonus we added. Without it, the link wins easily despite being a tiny element in the corner.

  This is the current system. It's a tower of special cases built on top of a foundation that favors interactive elements above all else.
