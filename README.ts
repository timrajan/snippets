 Excellent! Both are now working:

  However, there's one issue:                                                                                                                                                                                    
  [REPORTS] Loaded 0 suite runs from server                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The suite runs are being created successfully but GET /api/v1/reports/suite-runs returns 0 results. This could be:                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  1. Server-side issue - The GET endpoint might have a bug or require different query parameters                                                                                                                 
  2. User scoping - The server might filter by user and there's a mismatch                                                                                                                                       
  3. Pagination issue - The response format might be different than expected                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Can you ask the team to verify:                                                                                                                                                                                
  1. Are the suite runs visible in the database?                                                                                                                                                                 
  2. What's the expected response format from GET /api/v1/reports/suite-runs?                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The 422 error on "stop test run" is expected (test already completed/not running).
