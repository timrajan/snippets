  You already have the POST endpoints for syncing data TO the server:                                                                                                                                            
  - POST /checkpoint-results/bulk                                                                                                                                                                                
  - POST /reports/environment-info                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  But the client now needs to fetch this data back when viewing reports from the server. If these GET endpoints don't exist yet, you'll need to add them.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Would you like me to help define the expected API contract for these endpoints?
