 I see the issue now. The debug output shows:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  [DEBUG] Loading test run items for last_test_run_id: None                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  The last_test_run_id is None because:                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  1. The test run tree (folders/suites structure) and actual test runs (execution results) are separate systems on the server                                                                                  
  2. When you log back in, the tree is fetched fresh from the server - any local last_test_run_id we stored is lost because the server doesn't store this field                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  This is a server-side architectural issue. The server needs to either:                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  1. Option A: Store last_test_run_id in the test run tree node - so when a test is executed, the tree node is updated with the test run ID, and this persists across logins                                   
  2. Option B: Provide an API to query test runs by tree node ID - so we can find the most recent test run for a given tree node

  When a user executes tests from a test run tree node (e.g., "E-commerce Regression"), a new test run is created via POST /test-runs. But there's no link between the tree node and the created test run.     
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  When the user logs back in and selects the same tree node, we can't find the test run results because:
