The suite run was created successfully (201). Now there's a 405 error for creating test cases:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  POST /api/v1/reports/suite-runs/{id}/test-cases → 405 Method Not Allowed                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The endpoint for creating test case results is different than expected. Can you ask the team what the correct endpoint is for creating test case results?

  We need to know:                                                                                                                                                                                               
  1. What's the correct endpoint to create a test case result associated with a suite run?                                                                                                                       
  2. Is it POST /api/v1/reports/test-case-results with suite_run_id in the body?
