Hi IBM Team

Good day to you

I am reaching out to you regarding the IBM Mac machine to which I am not able to login. This is because I am not using the correct password. And each attempt makes it harder to try a new password. 

Is it possible to reset the password please. I tried to reset and it is prompting for a recovery key , if you could provide me a recovery key, that would be great

Can you please help me here please. 

Regards
Tim
