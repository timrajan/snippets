 I'll help you with Option 2 - delete from server and clear local sync status.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Step 1: Clear local sync status files

  Step 2: Delete from server database                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  To delete reports from the server, I need to know:                                                                                                                                                             
  1. How do you connect to the database? (PostgreSQL? What host/port?)                                                                                                                                           
  2. What is your user_id? (Or I can help you find it)                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Or if you have a database client (like pgAdmin, DBeaver, or psql), you can run these SQL commands:                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  -- First, find your user_id (if you don't know it)                                                                                                                                                             
  SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email = 'your_email@example.com';                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  -- Then delete all your reports (replace <user_id> with the actual UUID)                                                                                                                                       
  DELETE FROM report_network_logs WHERE test_case_result_id IN (SELECT id FROM test_case_results WHERE suite_run_id IN (SELECT id FROM suite_runs WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'));                                 
  DELETE FROM report_console_logs WHERE test_case_result_id IN (SELECT id FROM test_case_results WHERE suite_run_id IN (SELECT id FROM suite_runs WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'));                                 
  DELETE FROM step_results WHERE test_case_result_id IN (SELECT id FROM test_case_results WHERE suite_run_id IN (SELECT id FROM suite_runs WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'));                                        
  DELETE FROM test_case_results WHERE suite_run_id IN (SELECT id FROM suite_runs WHERE user_id = '<user_id>');                                                                                                   
  DELETE FROM suite_runs WHERE user_id = '<user_id>';
