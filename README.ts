  Investigation Needed                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  1. Verify the suite run is being persisted to the database (check the suite_runs table for ID ac47c028-df72-4455-9ceb-d395a746464c)                                                                            
  2. Check what user_id is stored on the created record - does it match 9e584a24-0151-4abe-aa47-9c790c25514b?                                                                                                    
  3. Review the GET endpoint's query logic - is it filtering by user_id correctly?                                                                                                                               
  4. Check server logs for the GET request to see the actual SQL query being executed                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Expected Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  GET /api/v1/reports/suite-runs should return the suite run that was just created when authenticated as the same user who created it
