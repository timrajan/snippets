 Backend Issue (You need to fix):

  Your FastAPI backend's /test-plans/{id}/tree endpoint is crashing. Check your backend server logs for the actual error. Common causes:

  The folder sync won't work until the backend tree endpoint is fixed.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  When it worked once (at 06:42:07), the tree loaded successfully:

  But then it crashed again due to the double-loading issue (now fixed).                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  Next step: Check your FastAPI backend logs and fix the /test-plans/{id}/tree endpoint.
