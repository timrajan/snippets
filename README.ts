  When recordings are uploaded to the server, the actions array (containing test step details like clicks, inputs, etc.) is sent correctly. However, when fetching recordings back from the server, the actions
   array is missing from the response, causing downloaded recordings to have 0 executable steps.

  Questions for Server Team                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  1. Is the actions array being stored when POST /test-recordings/{recording_id}/steps is called?                                                                                                              
  2. Is the actions field included in the database schema for recording steps?                                                                                                                                 
  3. Is the actions field being serialized in the response for GET /test-recordings/{recording_id}/steps?                                                                                                      
  4. If using an ORM, is actions being excluded from the response model (e.g., missing from Pydantic schema or marked as exclude=True)?

  Why This Matters                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  Without the actions array, downloaded recordings cannot be executed because:                                                                                                                                 
  - No selector/locator information to find elements                                                                                                                                                           
  - No action type details (click coordinates, input values, etc.)                                                                                                                                             
  - Test runs show "0 executable steps" and get skipped

  - Recording step model/schema - ensure actions field exists (likely JSON/JSONB type)                                                                                                                         
  - Recording step serializer/response schema - ensure actions is included in output
